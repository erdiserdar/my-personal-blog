                Hello! My name is Erdi, and this is my personal blog. I started this project to learn the fundamentals of web development, from PHP and MySQL on the backend to HTML and CSS on the frontend.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am passionate about Libertarianism and Austrian Economics. This blog is a space for me to explore these topics, share my thoughts, and document my journey as a developer.
            </p>

                Thank you for visiting!
